    /// into describing the same pool two different ways.
    ///
    /// The four cases are deliberate. A province with no ceiling reads as "none" rather than
    /// "0 / 0", because a desert holds no timber and that is a fact about the terrain, not a
    /// shortage. A mined-out province names what it used to hold, because the player needs to be
    /// able to tell "there was never anything here" from "we took it all". And an untouched
    /// province shows a bare number with no percentage, so a fresh world does not present as a wall
    /// of "100%" that means nothing until something moves.
