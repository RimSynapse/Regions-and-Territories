// Behaviour tests for the parts of ProductionScalingUtility that decide something.
//
// The façade itself mostly photographs the world and hands the numbers to ProductionEvaluator, and
// that photographing is not testable in a sandbox. Two things in it are not photography, and those
// are what this suite pins:
//
//   * SecurityOf — a genuinely new rule. R&T has no security subsystem, so Epic 3 derives security
//     from what the mod already measures: security is what your strongest rival has left you. If
//     that derivation is wrong, every contested province in the game produces the wrong number and
//     nothing else in the codebase would catch it.
//
//   * TryResolveResourceKind — the table that decides which pool an Empire resource draws on. A
//     wrong entry here silently charges mining output against the food supply.
//
// The last section is the one that matters most: it puts the two together and asserts the thing the
// child was actually asked for — that holding a province uncontested is worth more than sharing it.
