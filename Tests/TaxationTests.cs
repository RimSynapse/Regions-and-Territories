// Behaviour tests for Epic 3 child 6 — how much of a levy actually reaches the capital.
//
// Three things are worth pinning here, and only three:
//
//   * The collapse-to-baseline property. Every 0.7 model has it and this one is the most exposed:
//     tithes are money, and a player whose income moves when they update a mod will not read that
//     as a new feature.
//
//   * The asymmetry between this model and child 1's. Production's insecurity penalty is parked at
//     zero because it keys on derived security, where "no data" and "overrun" are the same number.
//     This one keys on rival pressure, where they are different numbers, which is the entire reason
//     it can afford a real penalty. If someone later "simplifies" this to take security instead,
//     these assertions are what should stop them.
//
//   * That growing a settlement is never a trap. Tiered production and tiered concession pull in
//     opposite directions on purpose, and the interesting property is a property of the product:
//     net collectible income must not fall when a town becomes a city.
