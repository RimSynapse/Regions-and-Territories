// Behaviour tests for the 0.7 regional resource model (Epic 3 child 2, pure core).
//
// ResourceEvaluator is pure, so this suite needs no RimWorld. What is being checked is that stock
// can be drawn down and recovered without ever escaping its bounds, that a faction which cannot
// scan genuinely cannot recover minerals, that the sustainable-population figure the model derives
// actually is the break-even point, and that none of it can silently destroy a province.
//
// The production half of this suite moved to Factions/Tests/ProductionTests.cs with the model.
