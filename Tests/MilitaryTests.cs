// Behaviour tests for Epic 5 child 2 — military reach as a function of contiguous owned territory.
//
// SupplyEvaluator is pure by design, so this suite needs no RimWorld at all: provinces are integers,
// the map is an adjacency dictionary drawn by hand, and factions are plain strings.
//
// Three things are worth pinning here:
//
//   * That this model is a relaxation. R&T has refused every non-adjacent military action since 0.6,
//     and a supply model that made an adjacent strike illegal — for a young faction holding nothing,
//     say — would be a regression dressed up as a feature. The adjacent strike must stay legal, at
//     zero attrition, from a faction with no territory at all.
//
//   * That reach is bought with ground rather than granted. The whole content of "contiguous owned
//     territory" is that a corridor of held provinces extends reach and a corridor of neutral ones
//     does not, and the gap between those two cases is the model.
//
//   * That the objective is not part of the corridor. Requiring the target to be held would make
//     every offensive illegal, which is the obvious way to get a supply model exactly backwards.
